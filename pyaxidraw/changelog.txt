AxiDraw API Change Log    

This document notes changes that affect the various interfaces. It does
not cover all internal changes nor bug fixes.



=========================================

v. 2.3.0 (December 2018)

Remove pyserial from distribution. It now needs to be installed on your
system in order to run this software. Remove axidraw_legacy.inx

25% increase in maximum XY speed now allowed.

Change installation process to allow installation via pip.

=========================================

v. 2.2.0 (September 2018)

The sysinfo mode now checks for updates. This behavior can be turned off
by editing the value of "check_updates" in the axidraw_conf.py file. 

Added axidraw_svg_reorder extension, and interface to use it from
within the CLI. It is not yet accessible from within the python API.

Added mode: reorder

Added new option group_sorting (-G), to select how groups are handled
when sorting the SVG file.

=========================================

v. 2.1.1 (August 2018)

Plots (CLI or Python API in Plot context) are now clipped at the
edges of the SVG document.

=========================================

v. 2.1.0 (August 2018)

Previous versions of the AxiDraw software truncated XY moves at the extents
of travel, such that a move to (-1,1) would instead go to (0,1).

Paths are now clipped with pen-up at the edges of machine travel.
This applies to both paths in SVG documents and individual moves in
XY interactive mode.

=========================================

v. 2.0.x (July 2018)
Significant changes to options, names, and syntax, for clarity and
compatibility moving forward.

Summary:

* Changed command line argument format
* Changed four mode+option combinations to be separate modes
* Removed some redundant and/or infrequently-adjusted arguments
* Changed names of most arguments for clarity and consistency
* Updated default value parameter names in axidraw_conf.py to match
* Added short names for arguments
* Output file name now specified by option argument, rather than by position
* Added new argument: "port_config"
* All boolean input arguments have been changed to input flags. That is,
    instead of using  syntax like "--reportTime=True", one now uses
    "--report_time" or simply "-T"
* Removed parameter "autoRotate" (default True) in favor of new optional boolean
    (flag) argument, "no_rotate" (default False)
* Changed pen-lifting and pen-lowering speed parameters to be a relative
 percentage (1-100% of speed), rather than an open-ended input.
* Default value of rendering is now 3 (full rendering, not none).
* Added interactive mode for direct XY control with moveto/lineto type commands
* Moved documentation from included text files to online.

== Changes to command line argument format: ==

Input file is now a positional argument; the first argument.
Output file is now specified with an explicit argument, rather than by position.

The input parser is now more flexible about the format of its arguments.

The following are examples of valid command line arguments:

python axicli.py filename.svg -m version
python axicli.py filename.svg -m=version
python axicli.py filename.svg -m="version"
python axicli.py filename.svg --mode version
python axicli.py filename.svg --mode=version
python axicli.py filename.svg --mode="version" 

python axicli.py filename.svg -T
python axicli.py filename.svg --report_time

python axicli.py filename.svg -C -T


Single-character commands (like -m or -C) may be lumped together, and may have their arguments
follow directly without a space.

python axicli.py filename.svg -CT
python axicli.py filename.svg -R5 
python axicli.py filename.svg -mversion
python axicli.py filename.svg -mlayers -CTl2  


== Changes to modes: ==

Removed mode "setup", in favor of specifying its two options as modes.
Removed mode "resume", in favor of specifying its two options as modes.

Added four new modes, to replace the two removed modes with their options:
    -m align:       Replaces --mode=setup --setupType=align-mode
    -m toggle:      Replaces --mode=setup --setupType=toggle-pen
    -m res_plot: Replaces --mode=resume --resumeType=ResumeNow
    -m res_home: Replaces --mode=resume --resumeType=justGoHome


== arguments removed: ==

Removed argument "smoothness".    (Still adjustable in axidraw_conf.py)
Removed argument "cornering".     (Still adjustable in axidraw_conf.py)
Removed argument "resolution".    (Still adjustable in axidraw_conf.py)
Removed argument "copiesOfLayer". (Use the main "copies" argument, now)
Removed argument "setupType".     (Replaced by new modes added.)
Removed argument "resumeType".    (Replaced by new modes added.)
Removed argument "autoRotate".    (Replaced by new argument, "no_rotate".)
